# onScreenCalculator
Make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

# Motivation 
The motivation behind this project is to build an onscreen calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to learn web development concepts and improve programming skills by creating a practical application.

By working on this project, we aim to:

- Gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Understand the basics of building user interfaces for web applications.
- Learn how to handle user input and implement interactive features.
- Practice problem-solving and logical thinking while developing the calculator's functionality.
- Enhance our understanding of fundamental math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This project will not only provide a platform to learn and apply web development concepts but also serve as a stepping stone for future projects and learning endeavors. We hope to gain valuable insights and improve our skills throughout the development process.

We invite everyone interested in web development or looking to build their own calculator to join us in this project. Let's learn and grow together!

# Build Status

This project is currently under development.

# Code Style
In this project, I will adhere to the following coding conventions and style guidelines:

- Follow the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) for writing JavaScript code.
- HTML and CSS code should be properly indented and organized for readability.
- Descriptive variable and function names are preferred to enhance code understanding.
- Use meaningful comments to explain complex logic or important code sections.
- File and folder naming should be clear and concise.

By maintaining a consistent code style, I aim to improve code maintainability, readability, and collaboration within the project. Please make sure to follow these guidelines when contributing to the codebase.

# Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear button: Allows the user to clear the input and start fresh.
- Backspace button: Allows the user to delete the last entered character.
- Decimal point: Enables decimal number input for more precise calculations.
- Keyboard support: The calculator can be operated using keyboard input in addition to on-screen buttons.
- Error handling: Displays a friendly message when the user tries to divide by zero.
- Responsive design: The calculator is designed to be visually appealing and responsive across different devices and screen sizes.

These are the core features that I plan to implement in our calculator project. I may expand the functionality further based on the project's progress and requirements. Feel free to suggest any additional features that you think would enhance the calculator's usability.

# Code Examples
